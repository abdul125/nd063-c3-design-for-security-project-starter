CRITICAL	Redshift.1	Amazon Redshift clusters should prohibit public access
CRITICAL	S3.2	S3 buckets should prohibit public read access
CRITICAL	S3.3	S3 buckets should prohibit public write access
HIGH	S3.6	S3 permissions granted to other AWS accounts in bucket policies should be restricted
HIGH	S3.8	S3 Block Public Access setting should be enabled at the bucket-level

**Amazon Inspector:
Medium	1.64043E+12	On instance i-068881b6fabbe416d, process 'systemd-netwo' is listening on UDP port 68 which is associated with 'DHCP' and is reachable from the internet
Medium	1.64043E+12	No password complexity mechanism or restrictions are configured on instance i-068881b6fabbe416d in your assessment target. This allows users to set simple passwords, thereby increasing the chances of unauthorized users gaining access and misusing accounts.
Medium	1.64043E+12	On instance i-068881b6fabbe416d, process 'sshd' is listening on TCP port 22 which is associated with 'SSH' and is reachable from the internet
Medium	1.64043E+12	Instance i-068881b6fabbe416d is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack.
Medium	1.64043E+12	On instance i-068881b6fabbe416d, process 'sshd' is listening on TCP port 22 which is associated with 'SSH' and is reachable from the internet
Medium	1.64043E+12	Minimum length for passwords is not configured on instance i-068881b6fabbe416d in your assessment target.
Medium	1.64043E+12	On instance i-068881b6fabbe416d, process 'systemd-netwo' is listening on UDP port 68 which is associated with 'DHCP' and is reachable from the internet
Medium	1.64043E+12	Instance i-068881b6fabbe416d  is configured to support password authentication over SSH. Password authentication is susceptible to brute-force attacks and should be disabled in favor of key-based authentication where possible.
