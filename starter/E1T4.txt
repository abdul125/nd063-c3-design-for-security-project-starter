Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1: the web service instance is in Public subnet 
justification 1: web service instance should be in private instance so that not anyone can access to that instance and accessible in better way such AWS session Manager

# Poor practice 2: Web Serverice Security Group (SG) ALLOWS all ingress traffic to Web service instance
justification 2: in this senario, the instance can get thro Application Load-balancer and directly from IG. Set SG to web service to get ingress traffic
from Application Load-balance (ALB)
